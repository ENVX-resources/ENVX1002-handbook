# Sampling distributions

First some definitions…

A **simple random sample** is a sample of size n drawn from a population of size $N$ in such a way that every possible sample of size $n$ has the same probability of being selected. Variability among the simple random samples drawn from the same population is called **sampling variability**, and the probability distribution that characterizes some aspect of the sampling variability, usually the mean but not always, is called a **sampling distribution**.

Sample means are extremely important because in experiments we apply treatments to samples of material and use the mean results or yields as measures of the effects of the treatments.

$\bar y$  is just one estimate of $\mu$, say  $\bar y_1$. If another sample of size $n$ were drawn from the population, we would have a slightly different estimate of $\mu$, say  $\bar y_2$. For example, if we take a sample of 20 from the herd of 100 cows in the Table below we may find that the mean is 16.025. If we calculate the mean for a second sample (say the values in columns 5 & 7 of the Table), we have $\bar y  = 17.055$. If we take other samples we could get more values of the sample mean, in general all different, and by taking sufficient samples we could obtain the distribution of the values of the sample means for a given size of sample. That is, this process could be repeated, giving many different estimates of $\mu$, say $\bar y_1, \bar y_2, \bar y_3, \bar y_4,...$  This forms a distribution of possible sample means,  $\bar y$’s.

Properties we would expect the distribution of the sample mean to have:

1. The mean value of the distribution of the sample mean would be the same as the mean value of the distribution of the original observations (since there is no reason for expecting it to be either greater or smaller). (Population mean of the  $\bar y$’s is $\mu$.)
2.	The mean of a number of observations should be a better estimate of the population mean so that we would expect the spread of the distribution of the sample means to be less than that of the distribution of the original observations.

*A result (without mathematical proof)…*

If a variable y is distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then the variable $\bar y$  which is the mean of a sample of $n$ observations of $y$, is distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $sigma^2/n$. The variance of the distribution of the sample mean is, as expected, less than the variance of an individual observation. 

The square root of the variance of a sample mean is called the standard error of the mean rather than the standard deviation of the mean. This term is used to avoid confusion with the standard deviation of the distribution of individual observations. 

The standard error of the mean is given by 

$\sigma/\sqrt n$ or $\sqrt{\frac{\sigma^2}{n}}$.

which is usually estimated by the standard deviation of the sample mean, 

$se(\bar y)=s/\sqrt n$ = or $\sqrt{\frac{s^2}{n}}$

- $se(\bar y) is a measure of accuracy for estimating $\mu$ such that:
  - $se(\bar y)$ $\uparrow$ as $s$ $\uparrow$ 
  - $se(\bar y)$ $\downarrow$ as $n$ $\uparrow$.
-	To halve the size of a standard error, the sample size (n) needs to be increased $4\times$; a reduction to 1/3 requires a $9\times$ increase in $n$, etc.

**Example: Root growth of rye grass**

Since the sample mean of $\bar y = 305$ mg and standard deviation of $s = 46$ mg was based on $n = 10$ pots, the standard error of $\bar y$ is

$se(\bar y) = \frac{46}{\sqrt{10}} = 14.5$ mg.

```{r}
s <- 46
n <- 10
se <- s/sqrt(n)
se
```

How many observations are required to have a standard error of no more than 5 mg?

Solution:

$se(\bar y) = 5 = \frac{46}{\sqrt n}$
$\sqrt n = 46/5 = 9.2$
$n = 9.2^2 = 85$

So n = 85 observations would be required

Notes
-	We now can also think of $\bar y$ being an entire distribution of values, but in practice we usually only observe one value of$\bar y$
-	If the original data is normally distributed, $y \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$, the distribution of the sample mean is also normal, $y \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2/n)$

Example:

- Rye grass root growth (mg dry weight), $y \sim N(300, 50^2)$
- Based on samples of size n = 10, $\bar y \sim N(300, 50^2 / 10)$,
i.e.  $\bar y \sim N(300, 15.82)$.

Two other mathematical results concerning the distribution of the sample mean emphasize the importance of the normal distribution:

1. If the distribution of the original observation, $y$, is normal, then the distribution of the sample mean, $\bar y$, is also normal.
2. For almost all forms of distribution of the original observation, $y$, the distribution of the sample mean,  $\bar y$, for a sample of $n$ observations, tends to the normal distribution as $n$ increases.

Continuing from the 2nd result…

In fact the tendency for distributions of sample means to become normal is so strong that, for many forms of original distribution, if n is more than 5 the distribution of the sample mean is almost indistinguishable from the normal distribution. The result, which is known as the **Central Limit Theorem**, is extremely useful. It can be used to explain why so many biological quantities have an approximately normal distribution.

**Example: Distribution of the Sample Mean**

Rye grass root growth (mg dry weight), $y \sim N(300, 502)$
A single root measurement is made.  How likely is it that the dry weight exceeds 320 mg? (i.e. $P(Y > 320)$)

Solution: 

$P(Y > 320) = 1 - P(Y \leq 320)$

```{r}
mu <- 300
sigma <- 50
1 - pnorm(320, mu, sigma)
```

Based on samples of size n = 10,  $\bar y ~ N(300, 502 / 10)$, i.e. $\bar y \sim N(300, 15.82)$.
How likely is it that a sample mean based on 10 observations exceeds 320 mg?  (i.e. P($\bar y > 320$))

```{r}
mu <- 300
sigma <- 50
n <- 10
1 - pnorm(320, mu, sigma/sqrt(n))

```

Note that it is less likely for a mean of 10 observations to be this “far” from the population mean, compared with a single value.

## The Central Limit Theorem

The Central Limit Theorem states that if a sample of size n is drawn from a population with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$, then the distribution of the sample mean, $\bar y$, tends to the normal distribution as $n$ increases, with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2/n$.

ILLUSTRATION of the Central Limit Theorem using Weights of 144 carrots (grams) in an arbitrary order [p. 23 Mead et al. (1993)]

1. Create a histogram of the individual weights (see below). Obviously the distribution is not normal.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
carrots <- read.csv("data/Carrot_weights.csv")

mean(carrots$Weight_g)
sd(carrots$Weight_g)

ggplot(carrots, aes(x=Weight_g)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  theme_minimal()

```

2. For these individual observations, mean = 301.896g and standard deviation = 221.313g.

3. Take 50 random samples each of 4 weights; then average each of these 50 samples. Generate another histogram of these means (where n = 4). How would you compare this to the histogram of the original weights?

```{r}
set.seed(1)
n <- 4
n_samples <- 50
sample_means <- rep(NA, n_samples)
for (i in 1:n_samples) {
  sample_means[i] <- mean(sample(carrots$Weight_g, n))
}

mean(sample_means)
sd(sample_means)

ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=sample_means), binwidth = 20, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  theme_minimal()

```

For this column of means, the mean = 301.435g and the standard deviation = 104.506g. 

**NOTE** The standard deviation here is actually the standard error (see earlier section in these notes).

4. Repeat the process, but now with n = 16. How would you compare this to the histogram of the original weights?

```{r}
set.seed(1)
n <- 16
n_samples <- 50
sample_means <- rep(NA, n_samples)
for (i in 1:n_samples) {
  sample_means[i] <- mean(sample(carrots$Weight_g, n))
}

mean(sample_means)
sd(sample_means)

ggplot() + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=sample_means), binwidth = 20, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  theme_minimal()
```

For this column of means (where n = 16), the mean = 300.796g and the standard deviation = 43.709g.

The means of our set of samples are of course not equal to the mean of the 144 individual observations but from our mathematical result that the variance of the distribution of means of sample of $n$ observations is $\sigma^2/n$, we would expect the variance of the three distributions to be $\sigma^2$, $\sigma^2/4$ and $\sigma^2/16$, so that the standard deviations should be $\sigma$, $\sigma/2$ and $\sigma/4$ respectively. Do our estimated values agree tolerably with this expectation?
