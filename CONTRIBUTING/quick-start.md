# Contributing

To contribute to this project you will need to first ensure that you have been properly configured. This includes setting up your workflow, installing the necessary dependencies, and understanding the project's structure.

## Quick start

These are basic instructions but will get you up and running quickly. **For more detailed instructions, see the relevant documentation (when suggested).**
1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `lab-11`).
3. Make your changes, and save/**commit** your changes frequently.
5. **Render the entire project to ensure that your changes have not broken anything.**
6. Push your branch to the GitHub repository.
7. Create a pull request in GitHub or GitKraken for review.

## Tips

Here are some best practices for effective branching and pull requests:

- Always create a new branch for each piece of work.
- Use descriptive branch names that reflect the work being done.
- Keep branches focused on a **single task or feature**.
- Make small, frequent commits with clear messages.
- Update your branch regularly with changes from `main`.
- **Test your changes thoroughly before creating a pull request.**
- Write clear pull request descriptions explaining your changes.
- Delete branches after they are merged.

Finally, as long as the main branch is always deployable (i.e. it renders without errors), you can be confident that your changes will not break the project.
