# Contributing

To contribute to this project you will need to first ensure that you have been properly configured. This includes setting up your workflow, installing the necessary dependencies, and understanding the project's structure.

## Configuration

1. The following needs to be installed at a bare minimum:
   - [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - for version control and collaboration in GitHub from your local machine.
   - [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) - to run Quarto and R code in a user-friendly environment.
    - [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html) - to gain access to the Quarto CLI which will be used to render into GitHub Pages.
   - [GitKraken Desktop](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - a GUI for git to visualise and manage your work. A *major* time saver, especially when working with branches and doing pull requests. Alternatively, you can use the official [GitHub Desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) or the terminal (not recommended for beginners). When you open GitKraken, you will need to **sign in with your GitHub account.**

## Quick start

These are basic instructions but will get you up and running quickly. **For more detailed instructions, see the relevant documentation (when suggested).**
1. **Clone** this repository, in GitKraken or otherwise, to your local machine. 
2. Think about what you want to do. For example, perhaps you are going to edit Lab 11. Create a new branch for this work and name it something relevant, e.g. `edit-lab-11`. **This step is important because it keeps your work separate from the main branch and makes it easier to manage and review.** 
3. Open RStudio and open the project file to ensure that you are in the correct working directory.
4. Make your changes. Save your work.
 5. **Commit** your changes every once in a while. This is a good habit to get into.
6. When you are ready to push your changes to GitHub, push your branch to the remote repository.
7. Create a pull request in GitHub or GitKraken (**not possible in RStudio**). This will allow your changes to be reviewed and merged into the main branch.

## Workflow

1. **Pull** the latest changes from the main branch before you start working. This will ensure that you are working with the most up-to-date version of the project.
2. **Always create a new branch** for your work. This keeps your work separate from the main branch and makes it easier to manage and review.
3. **Make your work manageable.** Pull requests should be small and focused. If you are working on a large feature, break it down into smaller tasks for multiple pull requests.
