Your demonstrators will use the start of this practical to discuss how you may be feeling for this first assessment and share ways you might want to approach and prepare for the assessment.  \n\nThis is the last reflective activity for now, thank you all for contributing so far and we hope you have found some benefit in the activities. Now for some probability!\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Learning outcomes\n\nAt the end of this computer practical, students should be able to: \n\n- calculate tail, interval and inverse probabilities associated with the Normal distribution \n- calculate probabilities associated sampling distribution of the sample mean by using simulation in R and using R commands.\n:::\n\nLink to data is below:\n\n- [ENVX1002_Data4.xlsx](data/ENVX1002_Data4.xlsx)\n- Alternatively download from Canvas\n\n# R commands for normal distribution\n\n- **Probability density function:** $f(x)$ = $dnorm(x,\\mu,\\sigma)$\n\nHere are the main R functions we'll use to work with normal distributions:\n\n- **Probability density function (height of the curve at x):**  \n  $f(x) =$`dnorm(x, mean, sd)` \n\n- **Cumulative probability (area under curve up to x):**  \n  $F(x) = P(X \\leq x) =$`pnorm(x, mean, sd)` \n\n- **Interval probability (area between two points):**  \n  $P(a \\leq X \\leq b) =$`pnorm(upper, mean, sd) - pnorm(lower, mean, sd)`\n\n- **Finding values for given probabilities:**  \n  $P(X \\le x) =$`qnorm(probability, mean, sd)`\n\n- **Generate random values from a normal distribution:**  \n  `rnorm(n, mean, sd)`\n\n# Normal distribution\n\n## Exercise 1 - Class activity - How tall is ENVX1002??\n\n1. Make sure you have an existing or new project for Lab 4 and create a quarto document called `Lab_4.qmd` (suggestion). Save it in your project directory.\n\n2. This is an anonymous exercise. Your demonstrator will create a google sheet (or similar) for you to enter your height and sex (M or F only so that the data is easy to analyse). \n\n3. Once all data is collected, manually enter the data into R or export the data as a .csv to be read into R, for example:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfemale <- data.frame(heights = c(176, 180, 187, 168, 160, 170))\nmale <- data.frame(heights = c(175, 183, 163, 190, 179))\n```\n:::\n\n\n4.

Discuss with your neighbour and class why the normal distribution is a good model for height data. Is it a good model for all data?\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Answer\n\nThe normal distribution is a good model for height data because it is symmetric and unimodal, which is consistent with the shape of the data. However, it may not be a good model for all data, especially if the data is skewed or multimodal. In such cases, other distributions may be more appropriate (you will learn about some of these in later weeks, or in other units in second-year).\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n6. How does your class compare to the Australian statistics. For this we will look at the mean and standard deviation of measured heights for men and women aged 18 - 24 from the ABS for 1995 see [page 13 of the pdf](https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/Lookup/CA25687100069892CA256889001F4A36/$File/43590_1995.pdf)\n\n**Note** that both reported and measured heights are provided and (not surprisingly) reported heights are bigger that the measured heights. What do you think the reason for this is?\n\n::: {.content-visible when-profile=\"solution\"}\n::: {.callout-warning}\n## Answer\n\nLooking at the ABS statistics, our class can be compared to the Australian averages for 18-24 year olds. The ABS data shows that in 1995, Australian males aged 18-24 had a measured mean height of 178.4 cm (SD = 6.6 cm), while females had a measured mean height of 163.9 cm (SD = 6.6 cm).\n\nRegarding the note:\n\nThe data shows a consistent pattern where reported heights are higher than measured heights across all age groups. For 18-24 year olds, males overestimated their height by an average of 1.6 cm, while females overestimated by 1.0 cm on average.\n\nThe likely reasons people report taller heights than their measured heights include:\n- Social desirability bias (taller height is often perceived as more desirable)\n- Genuinely believing they are taller than they actually are\n- Measuring themselves with shoes on\n- Rounding up to the nearest whole number\n- Measuring at a time of day when they're tallest (people are typically taller in the morning)\n\nInterestingly, the difference between reported and measured heights increases with age, with the largest discrepancies among those 65 and over (3.8 cm for men and 3.9 cm for women). This could be due to age-related height loss that people may not be aware of or acknowledge.\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n# Simulating height distribution\n\nUsing the ABS stats on female and male heights from the previous exercise:\n\ni) Use R to simulate samples of female **or** male heights for 10, 100, 1000, 10000 simulations and report the mean and standard deviation and draw a histogram for each. \n\nii) Discuss with your neighbour what happens to the shape of the histogram as your number of simulations increases. An example is given below for 10 simulations of female height. You can make a table in excel to record your observations by hand using the headings:\n\n\n| Sample size | Mean | SD | Shape of histogram |\n| ----------- | ---- | -- | ------------------ |\n| 10          |\n| 100         | \n| 1000        |\n| 10000       |\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1) # means that we all generate the same set of random numbers so we can compare\nsample10 <- rnorm(10, 163.9, 6.6) # generates a random sample of size 10 from N(163.9,6.6^2)\nsample10 # prints the 10 simulated values (you may not want this with the 10K simulations!!)\nmean(sample10)\nsd(sample10)\nggplot(data.frame(heights = sample10), aes(x = heights)) +\n  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = \"lightblue\", color = \"black\")\n```\n:::\n\n\niii) Find the probability $P(X \\ge 180)$ for each of the simulations and also the exact value.
