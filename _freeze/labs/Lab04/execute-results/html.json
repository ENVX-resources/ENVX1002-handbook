Your demonstrators will use the start of this practical to discuss how you may be feeling for this first assessment and share ways you might want to approach and prepare for the assessment.  \n\nThis is the last reflective activity for now, thank you all for contributing so far and we hope you have found some benefit in the activities. Now for some probability!\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n# Learning outcomes\n\nAt the end of this computer practical, students should be able to: \n\n- calculate tail, interval and inverse probabilities associated with the Normal distribution \n- calculate probabilities associated sampling distribution of the sample mean by using simulation in R and using R commands.\n:::\n\nLink to data is below:\n\n- [ENVX1002_Data4.xlsx](data/ENVX1002_Data4.xlsx)\n- Alternatively download from Canvas\n\n# R commands for normal distribution\n\n- **Probability density function:** $f(x)$ = $dnorm(x,\\mu,\\sigma)$\n- **Cumulative probabilities:** $F(x) = P(X \\le x)$ = $pnorm(x,\\mu,\\sigma)$\n- **Interval probabilities:** $P(a \\le X \\le b)$ = $pnorm(b,\\mu,\\sigma) - pnorm(a,\\mu,\\sigma)$\n- **Inverse probabilities:** Find $x$ such that $P(X \\le x) = q qnorm(q,\\mu,\\sigma)$\n- **Generate normal random numbers:** $rnorm(n,\\mu,\\sigma)$\n\n\n\n# Normal distribution\n\n## Exercise 1 - Class activity - How tall is ENVX1002??\n\n1. Set up a new **PROJECT** for Lab 4 and create a quarto document called `Lab_4.qmd` and save it in your project directory.\n\n2. Record the height of all male and female students in the class up on the board (we will try to provide a tape if you are unsure about your height)\n\n3. Enter the data into r, for example:\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfemale_height <- c(176, 180, 187, 168)\nmale_height <- c(175, 183, 163, 190)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n4. Calculate the mean and standard deviation using R and graph the distribution for both genders, for example\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nf_mean <- mean(female_height)\nf_sd <- sd(female_height)\nhist(female_height) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab04_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n5. Discuss with your neighbour or post on the zoom chat, which model (distribution function) do you think would fit the data\n\n6. How does your class compare to the Australian statistics. For this we will look at the mean and standard deviation of measured heights for men and women aged 18 - 24 from the ABS for 1995 see page 13 of \n\n<https://www.ausstats.abs.gov.au/Ausstats/subscriber.nsf/Lookup/CA25687100069892CA256889001F4A36/$File/43590_1995.pdf> \n\n**Note** that both reported and measured heights are provided and not surprisingly reported heights are bigger that the measured :o) \n\n# Simulating height distribution\n\nUsing the ABS stats on female and male heights from the previous exercise:\n\ni) Use R to simulate samples of female **or** male heights for 10, 100, 1000, 10000 simulations and report the mean and standard deviation and draw a histogram for each. \n\nii) Discuss with your neighbour what happens to the shape of the histogram as your number of simulations increases. An example is given below for 10 simulations of female height. You can make a table in excel to record your observations by hand using the headings:\n\n\n| Sample size | Mean | SD | Shape of histogram |\n| ----------- | ---- | -- | ------------------ |\n| 10          |\n| 100         | \n| 1000        |\n| 10000       |\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(1) # means that we all generate the same set of random numbers so we can compare\nsample10 = rnorm(10,163.9,6.6) #generates a random sample of size 10 from N(163.9,6.6^2)\nsample10 # prints the 10 simulated values (you may not want this with the 10K simulations!!)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n [1] 159.7654 165.1120 158.3849 174.4289 166.0748 158.4849 167.1170 168.7729\n [9] 167.7002 161.8844\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmean(sample10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 164.7725\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsd(sample10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 5.151867\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(sample10)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lab04_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\niii) Find the probability $P(X \\ge 180)$ for each of the simulations and also the exact value.
