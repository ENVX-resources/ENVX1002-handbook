In practice, this is fairly rare. More frequently we have samples drawn from two (or more) populations and we compare the two means to see if the treatments produce similar results.\n\nThe null hypothesis is that the two samples come from a population with the same true mean, $\\mu$. This is commonly expressed as\n\n$$H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2$$\n\nwhere $\\mu_1$ and $\\mu_2$ are the means of the two populations. The alternative hypothesis is that the two means are different, i.e.\n\n$$H_1: \\mu_1 \\neq \\mu_2$$\n\n## Assumptions \nThe two-sample $t$-test assumes that the data are :\n\n1. Continuous, \n2. at least approximately normally distributed, and \n3. the variances of the two sets are homogeneous (i.e. the same). \n\nIdeally these assumptions should be tested before you carry about the two-sample $t$-test.\n\n## What if assumptions are not met?\nIf the data do not meet either of these assumptions, then you may choose an appropriate *transformation* or look for another technique to use e.g. a non-parametric method (see non-parametric sections of this book).\n\nIf the variances cannot be assumed to be equal (but the data are normally distributed), there is a way of adjusting the two-sample $t$-test to compensate for this – it’s called the Satterthwaite’s approximation -- more on this later!\n\n## Three Variants of the Two-Sample $t$-test\n\nThere are 3 different ways in which a two-sample $t$-test can be used. They ALL assume that the data is approximately normally distributed.\n\n1. **Independent samples, equal variance** - run a two-sample $t$-test assuming equal variances.\n2. **Independent samples, unequal variance** - run a two-sample $t$-test assuming unequal variances.\n3. **Paired samples** - run a paired $t$-test.\n\nIn choosing which variant of the $t$-test is applicable in your situation, you first need to decide whether your two samples are paired or unpaired (independent).\n\n## Paired Data\n\nPaired samples arise when we measure pairs of similar experimental units. In this pair of experimental units, one unit receives Treatment 1 and the other receives Treatment 2.\n\nIn some cases, treatments are applied to the same experimental unit e.g. one half of a piece of fruit receives Trt 1 and the other half Trt 2; two plants of different varieties are grown in the same pot (here variety is the treatment).\n\nIn recognising this pairing in our analysis we are taking into account the fact that biological variation between pairs is likely to be larger than within pairs. This way, we get a clearer picture of the difference that is due to the treatment factor.\n\n \n### Examples of paired data\n\n1. Observations at two times on the same experimental unit\n    - Before and after readings of particle matter in the air on 3 sites near a new power station (before the station was built, and after it became operational). (Dytham 2003, 80)\n    - Measurements of water flow on two consecutive days at 6 sites along a river. (Dytham 2003, 83)\n\n2. Observations on 2 halves/parts of the same experimental unit\n    - One half of each (uncut) grapefruit was exposed to sunlight, and the other half was shaded (McConway et al 1999, p. 198).\n    - A standard (recommended) variety of wheat is compared with a new variety via 2 similar plots on each of 8 farms (Clewer and Scarisbrick 2001, p. 46).\n\n## Two-Sample t-Test for Independent Samples\n\nProcedure for the test:\n\n1.\tSet up the null and alternate hypotheses\n2.\tDecide on the level of significance, 5%, 1%, 0.01% etc.\n3.\tCheck the assumptions of normality and equal variance. We use an F-test to formally test for equality of variance. \n4.\tCalculate the test statistic $$t = \\frac{\\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_2}{SED}$$ where $\\bar{x}_1$ and $\\bar{x}_2$ are the sample means, and $SED$ is the standard error of the difference between the means.\n5.\tCalculate the degrees of freedom (df).\n6.\tFind the P-value in printed statistical tables or via GenStat or Excel.\n7.\tMake a statistical conclusion by comparing this P-value to your chosen level of significance (if P <α, then reject null hypothesis).\n8.\tCalculate the confidence interval.\n9.\tInterpret your results biologically.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Calculating the test statistic\nWhen calculating the test statistic, use $y_1$ as the larger mean. This will give a positive value for $t$.\n:::\n\n## Confidence Interval for $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$ (Independent Samples)\n\nA two-sample t-test shows whether there is evidence of a difference in population means. The magnitude of this difference can be estimated with a confidence interval.\n\nA 95% confidence interval for the true difference $\\mu_1 - \\mu_2$ is given by $$\\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_2 \\pm t^{\\alpha/2}_{df} \\times SED$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{y}_1 - \\bar{y}_2$ is the difference between the sample means, $t^{\\alpha/2}_{df}$ is the critical value from the t-distribution for the chosen level of significance and degrees of freedom, and $SED$ is the standard error of the difference between the means.\n\nThe df and SED need to take into account whether or not you are assuming equal variances.\n\n\n## SED and df for Independent Samples with EQUAL Variances\n\n\n## SED and df for Independent Samples with UNequal Variances\n\nWhat do you do if when you’re checking your assumptions for a two- sample t-test you find that the variances are not equal? You can go ahead with a modified t-test or you can choose a different test.\n\nThis modified t-test used in the case of unequal variances is often called Satterthwaite’s approximate t-test. \n\n\n\n### Satterthwaite’s Approximate t-Test\n\nThe null and alternate hypotheses remain the same i.e.\t$$H_0: \\mu1 = \\mu2$$\tor $$H_0: \\mu1 - \\mu2 = 0$$\n\nThe formula for the test statistic, $t$, in Satterthwaite’s approximate test is a little different to that for the t-test with equal variances. The s.e.d. changes because we can no longer use a pooled estimate of the variance (since the variances cannot be assumed equal).\n\n \nA correction for unequal variance is made to the degrees of freedom.\n \n\nThen proceed as usual through the rest of the test -  i.e. find the P-value; draw a statistical conclusion about your hypothesis; interpret your results biologically.\n\n\n\n##\tF-Test for Equality of Variances\n\nOne of the conditions for the independent sample t-test to be valid is that the population variances σ12 and σ22 are equal.\n\nTo test the null hypothesis that σ12 = σ22 divide the larger s2 value by the smaller s2 to obtain the variance ratio, v.r.:\n\n \n\nTo undertake this two-tailed test at the 5% level you need to carry out the one-tailed test at the 2.5% level. You can use the 2.5% F table of critical values, or you can use GenStat via the menus Data>Probability Calculations… to find the P-value.\n\nIf you use the printed statistical table, you will need to compare the critical value you find there with the variance ratio you calculated. If the calculated variance ratio > critical value, reject H0 and conclude that the variances are significantly different.\n\n\n\n##\tExample: Two-Sample t-Test\n\nWeights of two breeds of cattle are to be compared: 15 cattle from Breed 1 and 12 cattle from Breed 2 were randomly sampled. Their recorded weights (kg) are shown. \n\nBreed 1\tBreed 2\n148.1 \t187.6 \n146.2 \t180.3 \n152.8 \t198.6 \n135.3 \t190.7 \n151.2 \t196.3 \n146.3 \t203.8 \n163.5 \t190.2 \n146.6 \t201.0 \n162.4 \t194.7 \n140.2 \t221.1 \n159.4 \t186.7 \n181.8 \t203.1 \n165.1 \t \n165.0\t \n141.6 \t \n\n\n\n\n\nThe following descriptive statistics are obtained from these data.\n\n\tBreed 1\tBreed2\nSample mean (kg)\t153.700\t196.175\nSample s.d. (kg)\t12.301\t10.616\n\n\n\nIs there any systematic difference in their weights?\nThe question, “Is there any systematic difference in their weights?”,  is asking whether or not there is any significant difference between the 2 samples – and in effect if there is any significant difference between the 2 breeds because the factor that distinguishes the 2 samples is breed. \n\nWe could answer this question by testing whether or not the population mean weights for the 2 breeds can be assumed to be equal:\n\nH0: μbreed 1 = μBreed 2   versus   H1: μBreed 1 ≠ μBreed 2\n\nTo test this particular hypothesis about the equality of the means (as an avenue for answering our broader question), we would use a two-sample t-test.\n\nHowever, it is REALLY important to remember that there are other tests and hypotheses that we could use to answer our broader question (about whether or not there is any statistical difference between the weights of the 2 breeds). We’ll consider some non-parametric alternatives in Biometry 2.\n\nTo proceed with a two-sample t-test, there are 2 assumptions that we need to check:\n•\tNormality of Breed 1 data and normality of Breed 2 data\n•\tEquality of variances of the 2 samples\n\nBoth of these checks are hypothesis tests in their own right and contain the usual elements of a hypothesis test i.e. null & alternate hypothesis; test statistic; df; P-value or critical value; conclusion.\n\n\n\nTesting the Assumption of Normality\nIf you are doing the test by hand, you would need to assume that the data are normally distributed (and hope this is true). At least the data in this example is continuous… which is one small step towards normality.\n\n\n\nTesting the Assumption of Equality of Variance\n\tH0: σ2Breed 1 = σ2Breed 2 versus H1: σ2Breed 1 ≠ σ2Breed 2\n\n\n\n\n\nTest statistic: \n \n\nThere are 2 degrees of freedom to calculate for an F test. They are called the numerator df, 1 and the denominator df, 2. (Remember from school days, numerator is the top half of a fraction, denominator is the bottom half of a fraction.) The  that looks like a curly ‘v’ is the Greek letter ‘nu’. \n\nFor an F test used to test equality of variance, df are: 1 = n1 – 1,  2 = n2 – 1.\n\nHere, 1 = nBreed 1 -1 = 15 - 1 = 14  and 2 = nBreed 2 - 1 = 12 – 1 = 11.\n\nUsing the 2.5% F table, we can compare (at the upper tail) the Fcritical and Fobserved values. \nIf Fobs > Fcrit, we reject H0 and conclude that the variances of the 2 samples are NOT equal.\n\nFrom these tables, it is not possible to find   exactly, so we will make do with the closest possible value  .\n\nWe find  Fcrit ≈ 3.33 and Fobs = 1.34. Since Fcrit  > Fobs ,we CAN assume that the variances are equal.\n\nSo… assuming normality and equal variances, we can complete a “pooled” two-sample t-test where\n\n \n\nTesting the null hypothesis that H0: μBreed 1 = μBreed 2, we find that there is a significant difference in the mean weights of the two breeds of cattle (T = 9.46, df = 25, P < 0.001). The mean weight of Breed 2 is significantly higher and we are 95% confident that the mean weight for Breed 2 is between 33.2 and 51.7 kg higher than the mean weight for Breed 1.\n\nThis last piece of information, “we are 95% confident that the mean weight for Breed 2 is between 33.2 and 51.7 kg higher than the mean weight for Breed 1”, is obtained  from the 95% confidence interval for the true difference (μ1 – μ2).\n\nNB. Recall that a 95% confidence interval for the true difference (μ1 – μ2) is \n .\n\n6.10\tPaired t-Test\n\nWe can re-write the generic null hypothesis for a two-sample test of means, H0: μ1 = μ2 as…\nH0: μ1 – μ2 = 0, or\nH0: μd = 0.\n\nThe paired t-test is actually a one-sample t-test of the differences between pairs of observations (from 2 different samples). \n\nAssumption:\n•\tData is approximately normally distributed.\n\nSince we are doing a one-sample t-test on the differences then the assumption of equal variances is not relevant. Firstly, create a single column of data to use in the t test. Each value in the column corresponds to the difference between the 2 values for a particular matched pair.\n\n\nFarm\tYield\nVariety A (kg)\tYield\nVariety B (kg)\tDifference\n1\t17.8\t14.7\t3.1\n2\t18.5\t15.2\t3.3\n3\t12.2\t12.9\t-0.7\n4\t19.7\t18.3\t1.4\n5\t10.8\t10.1\t0.7\n6\t11.9\t12.2\t-0.3\n7\t15.6\t13.5\t2.1\n8\t12.5\t9.9\t2.6\n\nThe difference for Farm 1 = 17.8 – 14.7 = 3.1.\n\nData Source: Clewer and Scarisbrick (2001, 46)\n\nSecondly, find some summary statistics of the differences so you can complete the t test:\n\n\tNo. of values, n = 8\t\tSum = 12.2\t\t\tMean = 1.525\n\tVariance = 2.299\t\t\tStd Dev = 1.516\n\n  and df = n -1, where d is usually 0.\n\n\n\n\n6.11\tConfidence Interval for 1 – 2 (Paired Samples)\n\nA 95% confidence interval for the mean difference is  \n",
